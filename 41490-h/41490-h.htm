<p>HE 3.20 train from Boston
slowed up as it drew into a
way station, and Malcolm McCann,
grim and sullen from his
weary ride in the dirt and cinders,
the coal-smoke and the
f&oelig;tid air, the fretting babies
and hot, worrying men, that
characterise a railway journey
in August, hurried out with a grunt of relief.</p>

<p>It was not a pretty station where he found himself,
and he glared ill-naturedly around with restless, aggressive
eyes. The brick walls, the cheaply grained doors
bearing their tarnished legends, "Gents," "Ladies,"
"Refreshment Saloon," the rough raftered roof over
the tracks,&mdash;everything was black and grimy with
years of smoke, belching even now from the big locomotive,
and gathering like an ill-conditioned thunder-cloud
over the mob of scurrying, pushing men and
women, a mob that swelled and scattered constantly
in fretful confusion. A hustling business-man with
a fat, pink face and long sandy whiskers, his silk hat
cocked on one side in grotesque assumption of jauntiness,
tripped over the clay-covered pick of a surly
labourer, red of face and sweaty, blue of overalls and
mud-coloured of shirt, and as he stumbled over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
annoying implement scowled coarsely, and swore, with
his cigar between his teeth.</p>

<p>Ragged and grimy children, hardly old enough to
walk, sprawled and scrambled on the dirty platform,
and as McCann hurried by, a five-year old cursed
shrilly a still more youthful little tough, who answered
in kind. Vulgar theatre-bills in rank reds and yellows
flaunted on the cindery walls; discarded newspapers,
banana-skins, cigar-butts, and saliva were ground
together vilely under foot by the scuffling mob. Dirt,
meanness, ugliness everywhere,&mdash;in the unhappy
people no less than in their surroundings.</p>

<p>McCann strode scornfully to the rear of the station
and looked vaguely around to see if Aurelian had sent
any kind of a conveyance to take him to his home,&mdash;of
the location of which, save that it was to be reached
from this particular station, McCann knew nothing.
The prospect was not much better outside than in.
The air was thick with fine white dust, and dazzling
with fierce sunlight. On one side was a wall of brick
tenements, with liquor saloons, cheap groceries, and a
fish-market below, all adding their mite to the virulence
of the dead, stifling air. Above, men in dirty
shirt-sleeves lolled out of the grimy windows, where
long festoons of half-washed clothes drooped sordidly.
On the other side, gangs of workmen were hurriedly
repairing the ravages of a fire that evidently had swept
clear a large space in its well-meant but ineffectual
attempts at purgation. Gaunt black chimneys wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
with writhing gas-pipes, tottering fragments of wall
blistered white on one side, piles of crumbling bricks
where men worked sullenly loading blue carts, mingled
with new work, where the walls, girdled with
yellow scaffolding, were rising higher, uglier, than before;
the plain factory walls with their rows of square
windows less hideous by far than those buildings where
some ignorant contractor was trying by the aid of
galvanised iron to produce an effect of tawdry, lying
magnificence. Dump-carts, market-waggons, shabby
hacks, crawled or scurried along in the hot dust. A
huge dray loaded with iron bars jolted over the granite
pavement with a clanging, clattering din that was maddening.
In fact, none of the adjuncts of a thriving, progressive
town were absent, so far as one could see.</p>

<p>McCann turned away from this spectacle of humiliating
prosperity, and ran his eyes over the vehicles about
the station, searching for some indication of his friend.
He had thought that perhaps Aurelian might come
himself; but he saw no sign of a familiar figure, no
indication even of any conveyance that might belong
to Aurelian Blake. The greater part of the carriages
had gone, and now only remained an express-waggon
or two, a decrepit old hack, an old-fashioned chaise,
one or two nondescript country conveyances, and a
particularly gorgeous victoria, drawn by a pair of
splendid grey horses, a liveried driver sitting on the
box in Ethiopian state. None of these vehicles could
possibly belong to the fastidious but democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Aurelian, and McCann almost thought his telegram
must have miscarried.</p>

<p>A black footman in fawn-coloured livery, wearing
a small cockade of scarlet and silver, touched his hat
to the sulky traveller.</p>

<p>"Beg yo pahdon, suh, but ah yo Mistuh McCann,
Mistuh Malcolm McCann, of Boston, suh?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," said McCann, shortly.</p>

<p>"I have the honnoh to be Mistuh Blake's footman,
suh," and he touched the cockade in his hat again.
"Will yo have the kindness to follow me, suh?"</p>

<p>There was a touch of servile imperiousness in the
voice, and McCann followed in bewildered surprise.
"Aurelian Blake's footman"&mdash;that did not sound well.
Could his pupil have become a backslider in the last
two years? "Aurelian Blake's footman"&mdash;the idea
was surprising in itself; but the fact of the big victoria
with its luxurious trappings where he soon found himself
being whirled swiftly on through the screaming,
clattering city was more surprising still, and not a
little disquieting.</p>

<p>The carriage threaded its way through the roaring
crowd of vehicles, passing the business part of the city,
and entering a tract given over to factories, hideous
blocks of barren brick and shabby clapboards, through
the open windows of which came the brain-killing
whir of heavy machinery, and hot puffs of oily air.
Here and there would be small areas between the
buildings where foul streams of waste from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
factory of cheap calico would mingle dirtily with
pools of green, stagnant water, the edges barred with
stripes of horrible pinks and purples where the water
had dried under the fierce sun. All around lay piles of
refuse,&mdash;iron hoops, broken bottles, barrels, cans, old
leather stewing and fuming in the dead heat, and everywhere
escape-pipes vomiting steam in spurts. Over
it all was the roar of industrial civilisation. McCann
cast a pitying look at the pale, dispirited figures passing
languidly to and fro in the midst of the din and
the foul air, and set his teeth closely.</p>

<p>Presently they entered that part of the city where
live the poor, they who work in the mills, when they
are not on strike, or the mills are not shut down,&mdash;as
barren of trees or grass as the centre of the city, the
baked grey earth trodden hard between the crowded
tenements painted lifeless greys, as dead in colour as
the clay about them. Children and goats crawled
starvedly around or huddled in the hot shadow of the
sides of the houses. This passed, and then came the
circle of "suburban residences," as crowded almost as
the tottering tenements, but with green grass around
them. Frightful spectacles these,&mdash;"Queen Anne"
and colonial vagaries painted lurid colours, and frantic
in their cheap elaboration. Between two affected little
cottages painted orange and green and with round
towers on their corners, stood a new six-story apartment-house
with vulgar front of brown stone, "Romanesque"
in style, but with long flat sides of cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
brick. McCann caught the name on the big white
board that announced "Suites to let," "Hotel Plantagenet,"
and grinned savagely.</p>

<p>Then, at last, even this region of speculative horrors
came to an end, giving place to a wide country road
that grew more and more beautiful as they left the
town far behind. McCann's eyebrows were knotted
in a scowl. The ghastly nonsense, like a horrible
practical joke, that the city had been to him, excited,
as it always did, all the antagonism within his rebellious
nature. Slowly and grimly he said to himself,
yet half aloud, in a tone of deliberation, as though he
were cursing solemnly the town he had left: "I hope
from my soul that I may live to see the day when that
damned city will be a desolate wilderness; when those
chimneys shall rise smokeless; when those streets shall
be stony valleys between grisly ridges of fallen brick;
when Nature itself shall shrink from repairing the evil
that man has wrought; when the wild birds shall sweep
widely around that desolation that they may not pass
above; when only rats and small snakes shall crawl
through the ruin of that 'thriving commercial and
manufacturing metropolis;' when the very name it
bore in the days of its dirty glory shall have become
a synonym for horror and despair!" Having thus
relieved himself he laughed softly, and felt better.</p>

<p>Presently a flash of recollection passed over his face,
and he eagerly dropped his hand into a side pocket,
pulling therefrom a brierwood pipe, discovered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a sigh of satisfaction that a sweet heel of "Dills Best"
still lurked in the bottom of the bowl, and, regardless
of the amazement of the immaculate footman, lighted
it, and sank back in the cushions, well content. As
he smoked, his thoughts went back to Aurelian with
some uneasiness. "I am afraid he is a backslider," he
mused seriously. "Now, when I went over to England
a couple of years ago, he was a good socialist, the best
pupil I ever had. He would rail at the world in good set
terms, better than I myself. And now he runs a trap
like this, with a coon slave for a driver and a footman
beside him. Now, I <i>can't</i> lose a man like that; he was
a born leader of men, when leaders are what we lack.
Besides, he had a lot of money, and we need money as
badly as we need leaders. I must get him back some
way, if gone he is; and I very much expect bad news
from the boy when I get to&mdash;Now, what did he
call his place?" he pulled a letter from his pocket,
shaking tobacco ashes out of its folds. "Oh, yes,
'Vita Nuova.' Now, why the devil did he name his
place that?"</p>

<p>The stubby pipe sucked and sputtered, and McCann
knocked the ashes into the road. They had driven
already nearly an hour, and he was growing impatient;
"how much farther had they to go?" He asked the
coachman, who only replied, "Just a fractional bit
further, suh," which was indefinite. They left the
highway and struck into a hilly road where the hedgerows
grew thick on either side, with rough pastures
beyond, on the one hand, and on the other thick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
ancient pine forests, where the low sunlight struck
under the sighing branches and rested on mossy boulders
and level patches of golden ferns. Now and then
a grey farmhouse appeared in its orchard, and once
they passed a dingy white meeting-house, with pointed
wooden spikes on the four corners of its belfry, its
green blinds faded a sickly yellow. Just beyond they
met the country milk-team with its cantering horses
and clattering cans, the driver nodding on his seat, with
a watchful collie beside him. Then the pastures on the
right ended, and they plunged into deep forests, black,
almost lightless, where the road wound like the bed of a
dry torrent in a vast green cañon. The carriage climbed
steeply up the rocky road, with no sound around but
the rattle of pebbles under the feet of the horses, and
the melancholy calling of the wood thrushes. On the
crown of the hill heavy wrought-iron gates closed their
passage, gates that swung back slowly as the footman
whistled twice. They passed through, turned sharply
to the left, and in a flash were out of the forest.</p>

<p>Malcolm McCann had not a very keen sense of
beauty, but even to him the vision that lay before him
startled him into sudden enthusiasm. They were
riding along the comb of a ridge of high hills thick
with ink-black pine forests to the left, while to the
right they swept down in gracious undulations into a
basin-shaped valley, the level floor of which was, it
may be, something over a thousand acres in extent,
shaped like an elongated ellipse, with lofty hills rising
on all sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun dropped down and lay on the edge of the
world; from the farther side of the valley it poured
a suave, golden glory of molten light down over the
purple, serrated hills, that lay in the valley like amber
wine. Smooth fields of ripening grain and velvet
meadow-land chequered the valley irregularly, slim
elms and dark, heavy oaks rising among them. In the
midst, curling like level smoke, wound a narrow river
with black poplars and golden chestnut-trees leaning
above. In all the valley was no sign of a dwelling
save far away at the distant end, where from the midst
of thick foliage rose dark roofs and towers and chimneys,
as of some château on the Loire.</p>

<p>McCann caught his breath. "Is that the place?"
he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Suh, that is Vita Nuova," answered the footman.</p>

<p>HIS," said Eveleth, languidly,
turning his head in the valley
of silken pillows until he could
see the long figure of Aurelian
drooping in the Mexican hammock
across the big room
through the dim strata of blue
smoke that, in the silence, lay
almost motionless, swirled now
and then into subtle curlings and windings as some
drowsy smoker breathed more white vapour into
the slowly moving and rising tide,&mdash;"This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
peace of the land of Proserpina, the faultless content
of perfect possession. Philistinism is not without
honour, for behold! it has conceived and brought
forth&mdash;the Decadence."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"<i>Non sentir m'e gran ventura</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Porò non mi distar: deh! parla basso!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>said Aurelian, softly. "It is only a dream after all,
even a dream of the land of endless afternoon. There
is lotos mingled with the tobacco, but we wake
easily."</p>

<p>A deeper voice came from a motionless figure prone
on a tiger skin before the crumbling fire. "Opium
and Burgundy are not faultless substitutes for the
true lotos after all, but&mdash;they do very well&mdash;for the
time."</p>

<p>Murmurs of inarticulate assent rose and faded in
the opium-heavy air, and then the smoke grew still
again. Now and then a bit of wood fell in the fireplace.
Aurelian's narghileh gurgled and sighed in
slow cadence. These things were only a modulation
of the silence.</p>

<p>The room was vast and dim, seemingly without
bounds, save on that side where the violet flames of
a drift-wood fire flickered quiveringly, making a
centre, a concentration of dull light; for the rest,
a mysterious wilderness of rugs and divans, Indian
chairs and hammocks, where silent figures lay darkly,
each a primal cause of one of the many thin streams
of smoke that curled heavily upward;&mdash;smoke from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
strange and curious pipes from Lahore and Gualior;
small sensitive pipes from Japan; here and there the
short thick stems of opium-pipes, and by the motionless
Mexican hammock a splendid and wonderful
hookah with writhing stem. As the thin flames of
the dying fire flashed into some sudden brightness,
they revealed details unseen in the general gloom,&mdash;a
vast and precious missal gorgeous with scarlet and
gold and purple illumination, open, on a carved
oak lectern, spoil of some Spanish monastery; the
golden gloom of a Giovanni Bellini reft from its home
in Venice, and as yet unransomed; the glint of twisted
and gilded glass in an ebony cabinet; great folios and
quartos in ancient bindings of vellum and ivory and
old calf-skin, heavily tooled with gold, and with silver
and jewelled medallions and clasps, stacked in heaps
in careless indifference; the flash and sparkle of a
cabinet of gems, the red splendour of old lacquer; the
green mystery of wrought jade. And everywhere
a heavy atmosphere that lay on the chest like a
strange yet desirable dream; the warm, sick odour
of tobacco and opium, striving with the perfume of
sandal-wood, and of roses that drooped and fluttered
in pieces in the hot air.</p>

<p>Around a brazier of green bronze, on the floor, before
the fire, lay the three men who were gently
breathing in the bland opium, their dark figures radiating
from the queer brazier wrought of two ugly
dragons chasing each other around a great globe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Japanese chrystal, the firelight gleaming on the tall
glasses of champagne where the little column of gold
bubbles rose steadily. The fire fell together, and a
leaping flame cast a fitful light on heavy tapestry
curtains wrought with the story of the loves of Cupid
and Psyche. Its two halves parted slowly, and a
flush of red light fell through as, in the midst, appeared
a dark figure with closed eyes, swaying softly as it
leaned forward, and, while the curtains closed, fell
with a long sweep gently toward the brazier,&mdash;not
as men fall, but as a snake with its head lifted high
might advance slidingly, and as it came, droop lower
and lower until it rested prone on the uncrushed
flowers. So Enderby, heavy with the suave sleep of
haschish, came among the smokers and dropped motionless
in the midst of the cushions. The movement
set a tall glass quivering until it fell to one side,
and the yellow wine sank slowly into the silky fur of
a leopard skin.</p>

<p>Aurelian lifted his hand to a gold cord that hung
over the hammock. Presently a slim girl with flesh
like firelight on ivory, clad in translucent silk of a
dusky purple that made no sound as she came, appeared
in the darkness of the farther doorway. She
came to the hammock where Aurelian was lying.</p>

<p>"Will the honourable master be served with the
august saké?" she asked with a voice that was like
the fluttering of cherry blossoms in Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>"No, O Shiratsuyu," said Aurelian, drawing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
slim figure toward him, kissing the scarlet mouth
that drooped above as he lay full length, looking
sleepily upward. "No, O Shiratsuyu, but fill the
glasses of the honourable guests with the wine, there
on the table."</p>

<p>The girl glided among the drowsy figures, filling
the glasses. As she knelt by the brazier to lift the
overturned glass, her slim fingers lingered; a head
turned sleepily, and, as the lips fell on the little hand,
kissed it softly.</p>

<p>At a movement of Aurelian's eyes the girl vanished.</p>

<p>Eveleth half rose to look after her with delight.
"Where did you find that bauble, Aurelian?" he said.</p>

<p>Aurelian neither moved nor opened his eyes as he
replied, "In Kioto."</p>

<p>"She is more precious than your Delhi topaz."</p>

<p>"She cost me more."</p>

<p>"What is she called?"</p>

<p>"The Honourable White Dew."</p>

<p>"I have never seen her before."</p>

<p>"Nor any other than myself."</p>

<p>"I think she is a dream."</p>

<p>"No, only part of a dream."</p>

<p>"How long will the dream last?"</p>

<p>"Until dawn."</p>

<p>"What is the dawn?"</p>

<p>"Death."</p>

<p>The word roused ungracious thoughts in Eveleth,
and he turned his face to the wall, falling into a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dream. When next he looked toward his host it
was at the instigation of low voices. A servant was
standing by the hammock,&mdash;not the mysterious Japanese
girl, but a black boy in a red fez. Aurelian
looked toward Eveleth sleepily.</p>

<p>"One is without and craves entrance," said he.
"What shall I say to him? He has come as my
guest; shall I receive him here?"</p>

<p>"Is he an 'Elect'?"</p>

<p>"No, he is not an 'Elect.'"</p>

<p>"A Philistine then."</p>

<p>"Neither a Philistine, wholly."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"A product of Philistinism, an Agitator."</p>

<p>Eveleth looked vaguely around over the silent
room,&mdash;at Wentworth, throned in a stately chair of
mahogany and brass that had belonged to the great
Napoleon, still crowned with the garland of gold bay
leaves he had placed on his head after dinner, half in
defiance, half in jest, now sleeping, his chibouk lying
between his knees; at the abandoned figures motionless
about the bronze brazier; at Aurelian, clothed
gloriously in a sleeveless gaberdine of blood-red silk
over a white crêpe kimono heavy with embroidery;
at his own figure half wrapped in a big mantle of
rose-coloured damask. And everywhere the stillness
of Oriental sleep. As he looked he said dubiously,
"An agitator? Do you think an agitator would do&mdash;here?
Isn't there rather too much to agitate?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and for that reason I will let him come;
as it is, this is almost stagnation. He will amuse me,
I feel,&mdash;I feel, that in a little while, I&mdash;might be
bored."</p>

<p>Eveleth sank back resignedly and not without curiosity.
Aurelian nodded, and the servant glided away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hello, Aurelian!"</p>

<p>The words were like a stone dashed in the midst of
a pool of brown water, still, under willows. Wentworth,
looking like a Napoleonic <i>revenant</i>, shivered
into wakefulness; Eveleth sat bolt upright with a
start; even the opium-smokers, all but Enderby,
turned their heavy heads, wakened from mysterious
dreams.</p>

<p>The new-comer stopped in the door and stared,&mdash;stared
mightily. He coughed and blinked in the
smoky air. It was the clash of East and West, of a
fictitious, exotic East, of a commonplace, hard-headed,
practical West.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" McCann cried loudly, making
his way through the twilight toward the sound of
Aurelian's voice.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you at last," he said doubtfully,
"but I'm not quite used to this sort of thing, you
know; I feel as though I had drank too much." His
eyes fell on the confused heap of drowsy humanity
around the brazier. "Aurelian," he said sternly,
"is this a 'joint' I have happened on?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is my house," said Aurelian, in his gentle
voice, "wherein I have the honour to count you for
the moment a guest."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," grimly; "but as I said, you must
remember I am not familiar with this sort of thing.
I think I had better wait until you are less busily
engaged."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I am never busily engaged, and
I am never more idle than now. You will stay, of
course. Will you smoke?&mdash;I mean tobacco. I
think you smoke narghilehs; shall Murad come and
light you one?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, by your leave I will smoke my own,"
and McCann pulled out his brier bull-dog, filled it
from his own pouch, and sat down constrainedly, his
eyes fixed on the four men in their motley costumes,
strewn on the floor.</p>

<p>At once Aurelian began to talk to him frankly and
freely, as though nothing had changed since last master
and pupil had spoken together, questioning him of his
adventures in England and Germany while on his mission
among the socialist leaders. McCann noted with
surprise and with a feeling almost of reassurance that
no detail of recent sociological events had escaped Aurelian;
that he listened with equal interest to all that
he told him; that he showed keen satisfaction at the
outcome of two or three recent strikes in which the
strikers had been victorious. But all the time the agitator's
eyes were wandering over the dimly visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
details of the strange treasure-house where he found
himself. He looked on it all with growing resentment;
it was hardly to be called socialistic, and there
seemed to be a lack of harmony between these luxurious
surroundings and the words that Aurelian was
saying. There was something awfully wrong; but he
shrunk from knowing what he feared to be the worst.</p>

<p>After the first convulsion which his entrance had
caused, the different men had all fallen back languidly
in their places; but now Wentworth lifted himself
lazily and came down toward Aurelian and the agitator.
"Well, <i>citoyen</i>," he said, nothing abashed by his
fantastic garb, which was far enough from being the
same in which he generally met McCann, "Well,
<i>citoyen</i>, you come as a visitant from another world, like
the black steamers that crawl into the balmy vision
known to the children of men as Venice,&mdash;in it, not of
it. Can you bring a tale of the things without? Is
there anything worthy of note in Philistia? How fare
our friends the republics of the world, there in the outer
darkness?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said McCann, with indifference, "there is
another revolution on down in Guatemala, and one expected
daily in Brazil, and one in the French Republic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the smoke not yet cleared away from the
last revolution in Brazil, nor yet from the last
in Chile, nor yet from the last in Honduras;
wars in half the republics in South and Central
America, rumours of wars in Mexico and all the rest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the French Republic counting the days that already
are numbered by its dupes at length undeceived,&mdash;I
know the whole grotesque story, and yet people talk
about popular sovereignty and republics. And you
yourselves, McCann, <i>bon citoyen</i>, you agitators and
socialists, hug to yourselves the vain phantom of
popular government. You ought to know better, for
you know something of sociology if you <i>are</i> sweetly
ignorant on politics. What was that Balzac said, Aurelian?
Tell me."</p>

<p>"About popular government, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, he called it the only government that is irresponsible
and whose tyranny will be unchecked because
exercised under the name of law."</p>

<p>"Ah, this is it! Isn't that exact? '<i>A bas la République</i>,'
the King shall come to his own again!" and
he sung the words gaily to a fragment of an old Jacobite
air. "Don't interrupt me, Aurelian, the spirit is on
me and I must confound this blind leader." His tone
changed and he put his hand on McCann's shoulder.
"Malcolm, you know as we all know here that the
present condition of this happy world is very like the
Puritan idea of hell. You know, also, that the preserving
factor, if not the original cause of this pleasant
state of affairs, is the modern theory of economics and
its resulting industrial and commercial systems. Now,
what do you propose to substitute in place of this
gigantic abortion, this debauching incubus?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"State Socialism."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Out of your own mouth have you condemned
yourself. Man, man! what would your State
Socialism be in the hands of such a State as we have
now? In Chile? In Mexico? In any ring-ruled
mob-ruled State in this unhealthy republic? Why,
simply the biggest and most wholesale 'job,' the most
arrant corruption, the most awful and omnipotent succubus
that ever waxed fat on the blood of a dying nation.
Malcolm, you and your ilk have made a dreary
mistake; you think only of industrial reforms, while
to make these of effect you must first have a political
reform which will be in itself a revolution. Destroy
the present system, build up an honourable State, and
then it will be time to talk of State Socialism."</p>

<p>McCann had chafed furiously under this tirade, and
as Wentworth threw himself down in a low chair,
lighting his Dimitrino cigarette at the flames of the
brazier, he burst out violently: "You are all wrong,
you don't know what you are talking about when you
say we don't want a political reform! We do, a radical
reform."</p>

<p>Wentworth's eyes gleamed amusedly through the
rings of white smoke as he said quietly, "How?"</p>

<p>"I would destroy the whole system of party and
ring rule."</p>

<p>Wentworth smiled disdainfully. "My dear Malcolm,"
he said, blowing an ash from his cigarette, "I
spare you the humiliation of trying to tell me how.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Do you not realise that party and ring rule are the
necessary results of three of your dearest idols?&mdash;idols
that you would defend, I believe, with your life. They
are these: Manhood suffrage, rotation in office, and
representative government. Until you are content to
destroy these in your political revolution your attempts
to abolish ring and partisan rule will fail."</p>

<p>"They will not fail, for we shall abolish those abuses
through making the control of the people over their
representatives more absolute and direct."</p>

<p>"The exact contrary of the result you hope for
would follow from the course you suggest. I can't
convince you of that now; grant the truth of your
position for a moment, what would follow? You
would simply substitute for the repulsive rule of the
'bosses' a dreary and fleeting government of emancipated
slaves. We have seen the result of that in the
South, where we made fatal error in giving the black
slaves a measure of political power. You would do
the same by giving the white slaves <i>all</i> political power.
I say, emancipate them,&mdash;and govern them."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Their King and their peers."</p>

<p>"Where will you find them in this country?"</p>

<p>"Choose them."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"The people."</p>

<p>"Aha! Then you lose your point."</p>

<p>"By no means, for the franchise should be a privilege,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
not a right, and while the people should choose,
only their leaders should govern."</p>

<p>"You are a monarchist!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you are a reactionist, an aristocrat; no
socialist!"</p>

<p>"I am a monarchist and a vehement socialist."</p>

<p>"That is a paradox."</p>

<p>"So are most final truths, since a paradox is only
a concise statement of the colour on each side of the
shield; you remember the fable?"</p>

<p>"Then you mean to say that socialism and monarchism
do not negative each other?"</p>

<p>"No more than the silver of one side of the shield
negatives the gold of the other."</p>

<p>"You are a vain theorist!"</p>

<p>"It is you who are a vain theorist; my position is
based on history. I know the record of the attempts
to put the visionary theory of popular government
into practice."</p>

<p>"We have never had a true popular government
yet."</p>

<p>"I agree with you; but we have had true princes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>For answer Wentworth turned his head a little
and raised his eyes toward a great picture hanging in
the shadow. McCann followed his glance, and found
himself looking at the sad face with the mournful
eyes of Vandyke's portrait of King Charles I. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
England. Curtains of old purple velvet wrought
with Bourbon lilies of tarnished gold hung on either
side, and from their midst the King seemed looking
on them as in a vision. The picture annoyed McCann;
it was the presentment of a King, a tyrant;
he scowled at it ill-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You keep that there because it is a good picture,
I suppose," he said, turning to Aurelian, who had
been listening silently.</p>

<p>"Because it is a copy of a good picture of a glorious King,"
replied Aurelian.</p>

<p>"A good <i>King</i>!"</p>

<p>"A glorious King and most noble man."</p>

<p>"You talk like a Jacobite."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> a Jacobite."</p>

<p>McCann took his pipe out of his mouth. "What
do you talk like that for? You used to be a socialist."</p>

<p>"I am still a socialist."</p>

<p>"Are you bedevilled with Wentworth's theory that
a man can be both a socialist and a royalist?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How do you justify such nonsense?"</p>

<p>"By regarding both sides of the shield."</p>

<p>"I deny that socialism is one side of a shield, the
other side of which is monarchism."</p>

<p>"Then you should study history more carefully,"
interrupted Wentworth.</p>

<p>"Will history prove to me that monarchism is not
and has not been from the first the bitter enemy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the people?" cried the agitator, derisively, flashing his
eyes savagely on the languid Wentworth.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what it will prove," returned his
tormentor, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Well, I have studied history for twenty years,
and it has taught me exactly the reverse."</p>

<p>"<i>Histories</i>, you mean; but you must remember that
there is very little history in histories."</p>

<p>McCann gasped in impotent rage, but Aurelian
interposed with his low voice. "You will reach
nothing by such argument, my children. You are
both visionaries,&mdash;you, Malcolm, who dream of ideal,
impossible republics surrounded by the tottering ruins
of your fantastic fabrics, builded on the shifting sand
of popular fancies; you, Strafford Wentworth, dear
dupe of futile hopes, vainly watching for the King to
come to his own again. Dreamers both of you! I
alone am the practical man; I wait for that which
the gods may give. In the mean time I stand with
the 'divine Plato,' aside, under the wall, while the
storm of dust goes by. Forsake your forlorn hope,
Malcolm; stand to one side with me, and wait. And
in the mean time"&mdash;he lifted a strange Japanese viol&mdash;"in
the mean time, sing, and forget the imminent
night. Malcolm, there is beauty still left, and a little
art; it will last us through the twilight."</p>

<p>"Art will not quiet my conscience, nor blind my
eyes to the sight of rotting slaves and foul fat drivers."</p>

<p>"You take things too seriously!" cried Wentworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
biting the heavy leaves one by one from a
drooping rose. "It is like putting new wine into
old bottles to try to pour seriousness into this decrepit
and degenerate age."</p>

<p>McCann laughed aloud. "I accept the omen; for
the bottles, if I remember aright, were burst!"</p>

<p>"And you will spill your wine."</p>

<p>"The type of blood; and the blood of martyrs is
the seed of the new Commonwealth!"</p>

<p>"But why not take new bottles and save your
precious wine?"</p>

<p>"We have none, and the old are at hand."</p>

<p>"They are rotting fast."</p>

<p>"The world cannot wait,&mdash;mothers and children
starve every day."</p>

<p>"If you die for them it is only a life for a life, and
the guilty thrive."</p>

<p>"Some will go down with us to hades!"</p>

<p>Aurelian laughed softly, and rambled vaguely on
over the strings of his samosen, making strange music.
"Now we will quarrel no more, for we are where we
began. Malcolm, if you must go to your death, <i>Vale</i>,
I will offer a kid and honey on the altar of Mnemosyne.
Go your ways, and leave me to mine; I am aweary of
this servile and perishing world, rheumy and gibbering.
Here I have my books of the Elect, my fading
pictures, my treasures of dead civilisation. This is my
monastery, like those of the old Faith that, during the
night that came down on the world after the ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Rome, treasured as in an ark the seeds of the new life.
Here I can gather my Children of Light and bar my
doors against the Philistines without, among whom,
dear Malcolm, force me not yet to number you. Be
lenient with me, accept my hospitality; it will strengthen
you for your fight with the windmill that forces the
wind of God to grind men and women like grain.
In the mean time, it is still the youth of the night,
so I will give you more wine&mdash;or your favourite beer
if you like; I have some good Bavarian. Those four
decadents and the poor agnostic there on the floor are
happy. I never take the black smoke myself, nor
any of you: wise, all of you, but God forbid that I
should refuse any guest of mine aught! They, sleeping
in opium-dreams, have chosen their way. We
will choose another for ourselves."</p>

<p>HE night had grown old unnoticed,
and now in the first
dim twilight of coming dawn
Aurelian and McCann were
sitting on the wide terrace that
stretched along the south side
of the great house, smoking
lazily and drinking the fine rare
wines that Aurelian treasured
as he treasured his precious books. Not far away
the nightingales were singing in the thick wood;
other sound there was none save the sweet rustle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and stir of the awakening trees under the first thin
wind of morning.</p>

<p>At first McCann had raged inwardly at everything,&mdash;at
the crowded treasures of art that filled the castle-like
house, at the dominant luxury, at the opium, the
wine, at all the unfamiliar splendour that surrounded
Aurelian. He sat now listening unappreciatively to
Aurelian's quiet voice discoursing lovingly of the
Romanée Conti, which he himself could not have
told from Mâcon. "There are not two dozen of this
vintage in America outside of my own cellars," Aurelian
had said, and the poor agitator heard him miserably.
He did remember, indeed, when a slim glass
of amber Madeira was placed on the Indian table by
his side and its name given him, that some one had
once told him that Constitution Madeira was last
quoted in New York at seventy dollars a bottle, and
so he drank his glass with a kind of distant wonder,
but without pleasure; he thought it musty, he would
have chosen Bass. Yet, even as he lay in the long Indian
chair, the subtle influence of Aurelian's Lattakhia
and of his ancient wine worked slowly in his system,
and already he began to think with something approaching
tolerance of his pupil's apostasy. He lay
full length looking out over the carved balustrade
through the silvery jasmine flowers amid their black
leaves, to where the sky of blazing stars, already paling
before the advancing day, ceased at the edge of the
dark hills; and as he lay thus dreamily, he even wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
if he had realised all that there was in life, in
his career of feverish action.</p>

<p>Aurelian tossed the glowing end of his cigarette out
through the jasmine leaves, watching it fall like a scarlet
star. "Do you not see how it is?" he said; "I
know to the full the grotesque hideousness of life as
it is, and I long for revolution. But I have seen every
man who is fired with desire to bring the change yield
to the baleful influence of that which he would destroy
until he has come to see no ideals save those of materialism.
His ideal of life is a socialistic ideal of a
dead, gross, physical ease and level uniformity; his
ideal of government a democracy; his ideal of industry
State factories with gigantic steam-engines,&mdash;his
whole system but the present system with all
its false ideals, deprived of its individualism. I have
lived beyond this, I can see the futility of all these
things. I believe only in art as the object of production,&mdash;art
which shall glorify that which we eat, that
wherewith we clothe ourselves, those things whereby
we are sheltered; art which shall be this and more,&mdash;the
ultimate expression of all that is spiritual, religious,
and divine in the soul of man. I hate material prosperity,
I refuse to justify machinery, I cannot pardon
public opinion. I desire only absolute individuality
and the triumph of idealism. I detest the republic,
and long for the monarchy again."</p>

<p>"Aurelian," said McCann, "will you tell me
straight what you mean when you say that, yet claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to be a socialist? I asked you once before that empty-headed
Rip Van Winkle called Strafford Wentworth
in the other room, and you made an evasive answer.
Now, tell me, how do you reconcile the two?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe that political socialism will
destroy society and clear the ground for a new life;
because it will annihilate the Republic, and make
monarchial government possible."</p>

<p>"It will destroy neither, but reform them both."</p>

<p>"It cannot reform either, for the principles of each
are false."</p>

<p>"What do you fancy those principles to be?"</p>

<p>"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to call those principles false?"</p>

<p>"Liberty and equality false, fraternity impossible
so long as the first two pretend to exist."</p>

<p>McCann sat bolt upright. "Look here, Aurelian,"
he said seriously, "I can't talk in this way, I am not
that kind of man. What has come over you? I left
you a socialist, and I come back and find you an unreasoning
royalist, incapable of talking sense, putting
your defenceless fancies into the armour of paradox.
What in the name of common-sense do you mean
by it?"</p>

<p>Aurelian turned his handsome head and looked at
the red-bearded agitator. "Malcolm," he said gently,
"as you would say, we had best have it out. I have
changed, but not exactly in the way you think. As
I say, I am a socialist but also a royalist, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
many other things you would think equally bad. I
have done a good deal of reading of late, a good deal
of thinking; so I have grown,&mdash;more than you, for you
have only acted. And just that, if you don't mind
my saying so, is precisely the trouble with most socialists.
Look, this is the situation,"&mdash;he sat up with
almost animation in his face. "The world is in a bad
way, never worse; you taught me that, and the more I
study life the more convinced I am of its eternal truth.
Reform must come if we are to save this decrepit
world from a vain repetition of history; that of course
follows from the other assumption. Thus far we walk
together; but then arises the question of means, and
here we part, for you say reform may be won by agitation,
I say man is helpless at the present juncture and
can only wait."</p>

<p>"Men have not waited before; they have acted and
have won."</p>

<p>"Yes, for it was dawn and not the eleventh hour."</p>

<p>"What do you make of the French Revolution?"</p>

<p>"A reform undertaken at the eleventh hour, and
therefore merging within three years into hideous
deformity,&mdash;a reform that failed."</p>

<p>"You dare to say that it failed when it destroyed
feudalism and the rotten monarchial system?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for in their places it made possible capitalism
and the French Republic. Should your agitation succeed
it would result in the French Revolution over
again, together with all its corollaries,&mdash;anarchy, kakistocracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
a glorious tyranny on a false foundation,
kakistocracy again, and chaos: a counter revolution,
again a kakistocracy, and finally impotence, false and
evil as the destroyed feudalism."</p>

<p>"You are the worst pessimist I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Of course, for I am an optimist; and one can't be
an optimist touching the future without being a pessimist
touching the present."</p>

<p>"But how can you be an optimist with regard to
the future when you condemn not only the present
but every effort toward rebellion and reform?"</p>

<p>"Because you are trying to turn back a tide that is
almost at its full. Have patience, and the ebb will
come."</p>

<p>A great Persian greyhound, with white silky hair,
paced solemnly down the terrace and dropped its head
on its master's knees, gazing at him with soft eyes.
Aurelian stroked its nose gently.</p>

<p>"Malcolm," he said, "if you persist you will fail,
either broken by the power you attack or through
creating a condition more evil, more intolerable still.
There is a depth of fall below the point the nineteenth
century has now reached, and until that destiny is accomplished,
you are helpless."</p>

<p>"You break my heart, Aurelian," said McCann,
sadly. "When I went away you promised to fight
with me in the battle for reform. I thought you
understood me, followed me. And now&mdash;you lapse
into awful luxury and vice,&mdash;opium and things. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
is pretty bad, you force me to call you a recreant; here
on the very eve of battle you forsake the cause, you go
over to the enemy; and worse, you are a traitor, for
you debauch my men,&mdash;you have North now in there
drugged with opium. Last of all, you try to tempt
me, you urge me to give up the fight; but I am not
a deserter."</p>

<p>"Malcolm, dear boy, I don't deserve quite all of
that," said Aurelian, gently. "Yes, I have deserted
as you say, for I see more clearly than you; the battle
is already lost even before it is fought. I thought once
when you filled me with ardour of war that we could
win. I see further now. Dear Malcolm, you are
waging war against the gods; you have mistaken the
light that is on the horizon; you have waked from
sleep, but the flush of light that is in your eyes is not
the dawn,&mdash;it is sunset. You taught me that we lived
in another Renaissance; I know it now to be another
decadence, inevitable, implacable."</p>

<p>"You are wrong; the decadents have bedevilled you;
they are but the froth of the wave that has broken on
the shore: the wave of the New Life follows behind to
sweep them into nothingness. Leave the simile:
grant for the moment that you are right: are you a
coward to forsake a good cause that may fail? Have
you forgotten John Ball?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not forgotten John Ball, but I am not
made of the stuff of martyrs. Malcolm, I love life
and love, and the beautiful things still saved from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
wreck of worlds. You would make me&mdash;an artist&mdash;forsake
it all, and go shoulder a rifle, or carry a red
flag. I have a life given me, let me live. I am not
a fighter, let me be; let me live here in this happy
oasis in the desert of men. I can't help you, I can
only lay down my life on a barricade."</p>

<p>"That is brute selfishness!"</p>

<p>"No, it is reason. I know myself: I am of no use
to you; I thought I might be once, and I tried. Everything
sickens me,&mdash;every detail of the life that is now,
the stock exchange and newspapers, alleged art and
trade, and the whole false principle that is under it all.
I can't fight them, the contest sickens me. It is all
wrong, the principle of your reform; you are wrong
yourself. I can't have hope, and if I can't have hope
I can't fight. How can I fight for a reform that, if
it were carried, would only take the power out of the
hands of a sordid gang of capitalists and throw it
into the hands of a sordid gang of emancipated slaves?
Life would be as hideous under their <i>régime</i> as now.
You would change the ownership of cities, but you
would not destroy them. You would change the control
of machinery, but you would not destroy it. You
would, in a word, glorify the machine, magnify the details,
ignore the soul of it all,&mdash;and the result? Stagnation.
I have read your Utopias,&mdash;they are hopelessly
Philistine; their remedies are stimulants that leave the
disease untouched. Malcolm, you will fail, for you do
not see far enough. 'Ill would change be at whiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were it not for the change beyond the change.' They
are the words of your own prophet; you will, if you
succeed, bring in the change, and it will be ill indeed.
I wait for 'the change beyond the change.'"</p>

<p>"I deny that the change that we shall bring will be
ill; it will be the next step beyond where we are now.
There is no turning back: the law of evolution drives
us onward always; each new position won is nobler
than the last."</p>

<p>"Ah, that 'law of evolution'&mdash;I knew you would
quote it to me sooner or later. You hug the pleasant
and cheerful theory to your hearts, and twist history to
fit its fancied laws. You cannot see that the law of
evolution works by a system of waves advancing and
retreating; yet as you say the tide goes forward always.
Civilisations have risen and fallen in the past as ours
has risen and is falling now. Does not history repeat
itself? Can you not see that this is one of the periods
of decadence that alternate inevitably with the periods
of advance? The tide&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the decadence, the Roman decadence
over again. Were Lucian to come among us now he
would be quite at ease&mdash;no, not that, for in one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
we are utterly changed; so sordid is our decadence,
so gross, so contemptibly material, that we are denied
the consolations of art vouchsafed to his own land.
Even in the days of her death Rome could boast the
splendour of a luxuriant literature, the glory of beauty
of environment, the supremacy of an art-appreciation
that blinded men's eyes to the shadow of the end. But
for us, in the meanness of our fall, we have no rags of
art wherewith to cover our nakedness. Wagner is
dead, and Turner and Rossetti; Burne-Jones and
Watts will go soon, and Pater will follow Newman
and Arnold. The night is at hand."</p>

<p>He lifted a small hammer and struck a velvet-voiced
bell that stood on the Arabian table of cedar
inlaid with nacre and ivory. Murad came out of the
darkness, and at a gesture from Aurelian filled the
great hookah of jade and amber with the tobacco
mingled with honey and opium and cinnamon, placed
a bright coal in the cup, and gave the curling stem
wound with gold thread to his master.</p>

<p>Malcolm watched it all as in a midsummer dream; for
once he was succumbing to the subtle influences that
were seducing his yielding senses. He could not reply
to Aurelian, he lacked now even the desire. The slow
and musical voice, so delicately cadenced, had grown
infinitely pleasing to his unfamiliar ears, strangely
fascinating in its mellow charm. Wondering, he
found himself yielding to it,&mdash;at first defiantly, then
sulkily, then with careless enjoyment, forgetful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
everything save his new delight in his strange surroundings.</p>

<p>The rose-water gurgled and sobbed in the jade
hookah; thin lines of odorous smoke rose sinuously
to the silken awning that hung above the terrace, dead
in the hot August night. For a time neither spoke;
then at length Aurelian said, with a more sorrowful
gravity than before,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, the night is at hand, and the darkness at last
will cover our shame. It is better so. I thought once
that through art we might work revolution, and so win
the world to clearness of sight again; that was because
I did not know the nature of art. Art is a result, not
an accident,&mdash;a result of conditions that no longer exist.
We might as well work for the restoration of chivalry,
of the House of Stuart, of the spirit of the Cinque-Cento,
or any other equally desirable yet hopeless
thing. What we are, that our art is also. Every
school of art, every lecture on æsthetics, every art
museum, is a waste and a vanity, their influence is
nothing. Art can never happen again; we who love
it and know it for what it is, the flowering of life,
may only dream in the past, building for ourselves a
stately pleasure-house in Xanadu on the banks of that
river measureless to man that runs to a sunless sea.</p>

<p>"Individualism begot materialism, and materialism
begot realism; and realism is the antithesis of art.</p>

<p>"What else could have been? Art is a result,&mdash;and
a cause; at once the flower of life and the seed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the age to come. That age which through its meanness
and poverty is barren of blooms leaves no seed for
its own propagation. Good-night then to art; for the
time its day is done. Intelligence and erudition may
create a creditable archæology, and a blind generation
may&mdash;nay, has&mdash;mistaken this for art. Well, its
folly is fond and pitiful.</p>

<p>"Do you not see, then, how the discovery of this
thing must fill me with that despair which kills all
effort? You will say, 'Rise then, gird thyself with
the sword of scorn and invective, and strike with exaltation
at the false civilisation which is the death of
art and of all that is worthy in life.' Dear boy, our
fathers in their fond, visionary idealism made for all
time such warfare of no avail. By cunning schemes
and crafty mechanism they, impelled by most honourable
motives, have woven a System which is now not
alone the System of these United States but of that
Europe which we have dragged to our level; a System
which is now being accepted by that pure and happy
civilisation, the last to yield to our importunity, Japan,
and being accepted to its own damnation. And that
System has made impossible forever any successful
result; for so dominant is it, so subtle in its influence,
so almighty in its power, that human strength is
helpless before it. Moreover, it will, through its infinite
craft, seem to yield now and then, yet only in
form; for it will so debauch the reformers that they
will think now and again their cause is won, yet will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
it have lost every element of desirability. Nevertheless
'the People' will shout with acclamation, 'Victory!
glorious victory! won through the strength of
our immortal and matchless institutions.' And all
the while they are shouting for the shadow of revolution,
for the dead body from which the soul has
fled.</p>

<p>"'What is this System,' do you say? I will tell you;
it is the system of the nineteenth century, by which
it will be known in the histories of times to come,
should time continue,&mdash;the great three-fold system
of Equality, The Freedom of the Press, and Public
Opinion. You yourself do them honour, for that
you yourself have yielded to their evil influence;
until you have risen once for all superior to their
plausible sophistry, every thought you have, every
act you are guilty of, will be tainted by them and made
of no avail. The whole world kneels before them
now, confessing their dominion. So long as this is
so, so long will reform be impossible.</p>

<p>"Democracy, Public Opinion, Freedom of the
Press,&mdash;the idolatrous tritheism of a corrupt generation.
Through the Institution of Democracy you
have bound yourself with invincible chains to a
political system which is the government of the best,
by the worst, for the few,&mdash;in other words, the suppression
of the intelligent few by the mob for the
bosses. By the Institution of Public Opinion you
have made Democracy permanent, preventing forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the rule of the 'saving remnant.' You have founded
your unholy inquisition for the suppression of the
martyrs to wisdom, and by your Institution of the
Freedom of the Press you have raised a tyranny, an
irresponsible hierarchy of godless demagogues, an
impeccable final authority which will suppress, as it
suppresses now, all honourable freedom of thought.
You have broken and destroyed the power of the
Church, and you are proud thereof; but beware!
for in its place you have builded a Power, more
widespread, more overwhelming, more irresistible.
Though you crushed Democracy and discredited
Public Opinion, yet so long as the Freedom of the
Press remained in existence, Journalism would by its
bull of deposition, its anathema of excommunication,
extinguish your labour in a breath.</p>

<p>"Here is your triple-headed Cerberus that bars your
exit from this hades you have made. Until he is slain
you may never escape. Slain? You cannot slay him;
he is sheathed in an impenetrable hide, proof against
all assaults. Listen, only in one way may you pass
by him. Wait! In a little time his three horrid
heads will growl with rising fury each to each, over
the enormous spoils of decaying life. Wait! and the
growls will grow fierce and more furious; and at last
in mortal and horrible combat the beast will strive
with <i>itself</i>, spreading chaos and death around. So
will it disable itself; and when at last its triple head
has collapsed in ghastly exhaustion, then will the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
have come: pile upon it the hoary boulders of experience
left by immemorial glaciers of time; raise
them into a mountain, and though, like imprisoned
Titan, the horrid beast bellows and thunders below,
you may go forth fearlessly, and on the dread ruin he
has wrought build a new civilisation, a new life."</p>

<p>Aurelian's ardent eyes gazed on the man before him
through the writhing smoke in the pallid dawn; his
voice was like the voice of a velvet bell.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the end of years; the era of action is
over, night follows, blotting from sight the shame of a
wasted world; but through the mute, unutterable night
rises and brightens the splendour of the new day, the
new life. Action has striven and failed, and wreck
and ruin are the ending thereof; but across the desert
of failure and despair bursts the flame of the Dawn; the
far-forgotten spirit of the world rises toward dominion
again,&mdash;the spirit of visions and dreams, the mighty
Mother of worlds and men, the Soul of the Eternal
East."</p>

<p>Aurelian had risen and stood facing McCann, his
white face lighted by a flame of sudden vigour and
inspiration; but even as he finished speaking it
changed. His eyes grew soft, and he smiled gently.
"Malcolm," he said, coming to the speechless agitator,
and laying an arm lightly over his broad shoulders,
"Malcolm, I shall hardly forgive you this. You have
made me almost enthusiastic again; for a moment I
could have believed once more there was virtue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
action; that has passed, and I am myself again. And
now, look!"</p>

<p>The sun rose, and its level river of light swept
through the valley. A mist like vaporous opals
rose slowly from the winding river below them, curling
in the amber air and brushing itself in thin plumes
over the pale sky. Down from the terrace stretched
the great garden, where multitudinous lilies flashed in
the first light with iridescent dew. A splendid
peacock swept flauntingly through the mazy walks
and among the white statues until it reached the
central fountain, where it spread itself in the sun. At
the foot of the last terrace, where the marble steps
turned to serpentine in the still water, a small white
boat with prow of gilded fretwork lay motionless
among the opening water-lilies and the great blooms
of the lotos. The breath of honeysuckle and jasmine
and day-lilies and tuberoses drifted slowly up in the
first stirring wind. The river-mist lifted, showing
the golden meadows with the slim elms here and there
and the lofty hills fringed with dark forests beyond.</p>

<p>"Malcolm," said Aurelian, "beyond those fortress
hills lies the world,&mdash;the nineteenth century, seething
with impotent tumult,&mdash;festering towns of shoe
factories and cotton-mills, lying tradesmen and legalised
piracy; pork-packing, stock-brokers, quarrelling
and snarling sectaries, and railroads; politicians, mammonism,
realism, and newspapers. Within my walls,
which are the century-living pines, is the world of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
past and of the future, of the fifteenth century and
of the twentieth century. Here have I gathered all
my treasures of art and letters; here may those I love
find rest and refreshment when worn out with hopeless
lighting. Suffer me to live here and forget, or
live in a living dream of dreamless life. Against my
hilly ramparts life may beat in vain,&mdash;it cannot enter.
Here I am a King; humour my fancy, and give over
your striving to make a poet into a warrior. There
is other work before me. Even as in the monasteries
of the sixth century the wise monks treasured the priceless
records of a dead life until the night had passed
and the white day of mediævalism dawned on the
world, so suffer me to dream in my cloister through
evil days; for the night has come when man may no
longer work."</p>
